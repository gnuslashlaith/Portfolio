# Portfolio

Hello this is my personal website, gnuslashlaith. get it cause GNU/Linux but like my name, laith. I think its pretty genius. It holds (or will hold) a bunch of my personal stuff, a little project highlight in the home page
and some of my music and writings and such. 

I made this portfolio because the one that I had in the past was just so plain and boring. It was a dark gray screen with a bunch of boxes. If I were surfing the web and came across that, I would not be compelled to look further.
TBH. But I tried to change that a bit with this portfolio by giving it a little bit of omph to it, some flavor yk. I like it, its not as technically advanced as I'd like it to be but I am very new to web dev as I usually do 
Rust things and Hardware things... mehehe... but its good to try new things sometimes.

## Tech Stack and other Information

As I've mentioned before its not super advanced, pretty vanilla with the stack. Vanilla JS (like a few lines of it), HTML, plain old CSS. I kinda just jumbled together a bunch of stuff I learned from my Web and Design class
and also it was a lot of trial and error. As for my struggles, errm there were a lot more than I'd like to admit. 

There's some line of code in here that's like "transform: translateX(-1000%);". I think that means that there's a *better* way to go about that, but I dunno. I know that on phone the website looks pretty janky because the positionings
on here aren't very responsive when it comes to varying screen sizes, especially the home page because things are aligned differently. That's something that was a lot harder than I anticipated it to be. But ALAS! the website is made and 
in my opinion it looks beautiful. I really liked adding my music in and the little disc with the nyan cat and stuff, I think it gave it a bit of flaaavor. 


also the song playing when you click the disc is by LEASE by Takeshi Abo. I wish I could tell y'all where the music disc art is from but I caught it off pinterest and like multiple people uploaded it so I dunno the artist.
